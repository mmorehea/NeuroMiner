The following packages should be installed by default as part of Anaconda:
+ pandas (can be installed as part of anaconda)
+ requests (also included in anaconda)
+ BeautifulSoup4
+ html5lib

```
sudo pip install beautiful-soup-4
sudo pip install html5lib
sudo pip install requests
sudo pip install pandas
```


The latter two are integral for the "read_html()" function in the program to work.
