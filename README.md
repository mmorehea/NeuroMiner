# NeuroMiner
The following packages should be installed by default as part of Anaconda:
+ pandas
+ requests
+ beautifulsoup4

This one is probably not included for you:
+ html5lib

Any that weren't included can be installed using:
```
sudo pip install beautifulsoup4
sudo pip install html5lib
sudo pip install requests
sudo pip install pandas
```


beautifulsoup4 and html5lib are integral for the "read_html()" function in the program to work.
