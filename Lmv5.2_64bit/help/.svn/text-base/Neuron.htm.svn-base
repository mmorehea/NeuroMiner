<p><font color="#660066">This page provides detailed definitions (and
demonstrations) for all morphometric functions of L-Measure.</font></p>
<p><font color="#660066">The following brief Introduction to Basic
Terminology and Data Structures is helpful to parse the individual
functions<br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#660066"> with reference to the schematic diagram of a
neuron:</font></p>

<p><font color="#cc0033">Compartment:</font><font color="#660066"> Is
the smallest structural unit. A compartment corresponds to the
cylinder between two consecutive tracing points, and can be represented
by the 3D coordinates of its starting and ending points, and its
diameter. Examples of functions at the compartment level: Diameter,
length, Volume, etc.,</font></p>
<p><font color="#cc0033">Branch:</font> <font color="#660066">A branch
is the portion of a tree between the soma and the first bifurcation,
between two bifurcations, or between a bifurcation and a termination
point. A branch is typically composed of a number of compartments.
Examples of functions at the branch level: N_branch, Branch_Order,
Branch_pathlength, etc.,</font></p>
<p><font color="#cc0033">Bifurcation:</font> <font color="#660066">A
Bifucation is a 'Y' shaped split in the arborization, and has one
parent and (</font><font color="#660066">in binary trees) </font><font
 color="#660066">two daughters. Examples of functions at the
bifurcation level: Bif_torque_local, Bif_torque_remote, Bif_tilt_local,
Parent_daughter_Ratio, Daughter_Ratio, Pk, Rall_power etc.,</font></p>
<p><font color="#cc0033">Soma:</font> <font color="#660066">Is
represented as a Sphere or as set of compartments depending on the file
format. Whenever the Compartment level/Bifurcation level/Branch level
functions are computed, the compartments constituting the soma are not
considered. Example of function: Soma_surface</font></p>
<p><font color="#003333"><b><font color="#006633">HOW TO USE</font></b></font><br>
Experienced users will combine a number of morphometric functions to
extract meaningful measures. <font color="#660066">For example,
combination of N_branch, Euclidean distance, and diameter could result
in a series of Sholl plots, each for a given value of branch thickness.</font></p>
